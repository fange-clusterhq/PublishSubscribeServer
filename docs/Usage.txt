Instruction of Use:
1. git clone the repo.
2. In the project root directory, run 'make'
3. The binary will be created under bin/.
4. To run: ./bin/publishSubscribeServer -p <port>

Note: I have only tested the implementation on Ubuntu 14.04 and Mac El
Capitan. C++ 11 is used in the project and therefore the right g++ is
required.
